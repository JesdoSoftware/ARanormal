# ARanormal

An augmented reality (AR) ghost hunting simulation for iPhone

## About

ARanormal was the first game by Jesdo Software, released for iPhone in October 2016. Though it's no longer distributed on the App Store, we're making the source code available, both to celebrate Jesdo Software's fifth anniversary, and to demonstrate a commitment to open source and software preservation.

Despite releasing the source code, we consider ARanormal a legacy project, and do not intend to maintain it, release any new versions, or offer support.

## Compatibility

ARanormal was developed with Swift 3.x, which current versions of Xcode don't support. You may need to use an older version of Xcode to get it working.

## Third-Party Assets

The release of ARanormal distributed on the App Store used a number of assets provided by third parties, which we don't have permission to distribute with the source code. Xcode will highlight these missing asset files in red.

The required third-party assets include:

### Frameworks

- OpenEars: https://www.politepix.com/openears/
- Rejecto: https://www.politepix.com/rejecto/

### Audiovisual

- Picons Basic: https://picons.me/basic.php
- SCM Zephyr Deluxe font by Aleksandar Stevanov: https://www.behance.net/Stevanov
- Various sound files

The image files `Ghost.png` and `Eyes.png`, created by me, are included in this source code distribution as a testament to why I should always collaborate with others on a game's graphics and presentation.
